# Team TS Project Manifesto

This document details the project manifesto for our work as Team TS.

We believe in communication - making sure everyone is working with the same understanding.

We believe in learning above success - growth is more important than meeting deadlines.

We seek to challenge ourselves more than we seek to be comfortable.

We believe in equal voices - no one person controls the conversation.
